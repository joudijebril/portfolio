<h1>About Me</h1>

  I have been to many many countries but i was born in Syria. My ethnicity is mixed. I'm half Egyptian , half syrian.
  I was raised in Saudi arabia and came to the states when i was 16 years old.

<p>I wanna make new websites and learn more and more everyday about web development. Ever since I took this course it has been life changing.
  All i wanna do is code and program websites and hopefully soon enough have my own very websites.
